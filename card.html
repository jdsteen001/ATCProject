			<!-- your favorite animal's description goes here -->
			<p>The Shiba Inu is a unique breed of dog in that it has a lot of characteristics that are much more
			cat-like than dog-like. Its history as a hunting companion has made it very independent with an almost
		  introverted personality. However, they are fiercely loyal dogs and when comfortable in their surroundings
		  become much more outgoing and animated. Shiba's are extremely smart and clever, and are described as
		  "escape artists." New owners are warned to properly fence in their yards, and purchase a harness in place
			of a regular collar. Shiba's can range in color from pure-white, pure-black, a mix of black & white, or
		  different shades of brown. Most darker-fur Shiba Inu's will have some lighter areas in their coat.</p>
